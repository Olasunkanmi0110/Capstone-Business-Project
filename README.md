# Capstone-Business-Project
I explored the attached dataset to uncover valuable insights that can support data-driven decisions. I examined the data for inconsistencies and performed necessary cleaning. A star schema data model was then developed to structure the information effectively. Using relevant DAX calculations, including time-based measures and comparisons, I extracted deeper insights to better understand business trends. I visualised these findings through clear, interactive dashboards. On the first page of this report, I have provided five actionable recommendations aimed at helping AILEAD and Co scale operations and improve overall business performance.
